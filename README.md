# EdTech Market Segmentation
This project performs market segmentation analysis for EdTech startups using unsupervised machine learning techniques. It leverages clustering algorithms to identify unique user segments based on behavioral and demographic data, enabling strategic decision-making for marketing and product personalization.
## Overview
- **Goal:** Segment users based on patterns in engagement, demographics, and responses
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML Techniques:** K-Means Clustering, Elbow Method, PCA
- **Visualization:** Scatter plots, Heatmaps, Cluster visualizations
## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of raw EdTech dataset
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA for improved clustering
- Automated selection of optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
- Identification of distinct customer personas for tailored strategies
- Visualization of clustered data to interpret group behavior and value
## Getting Started
